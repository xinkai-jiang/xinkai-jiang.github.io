My name is Xinkai Jiang, 
a PhD student in [Intuitive Robot Lab (IRL)](https://www.irl.iar.kit.edu/) and [Autonomous Learning Robots (ALR) Lab](https://alr.iar.kit.edu/index.php) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
I am supervised by [Prof. Dr. Rudolf Lioutikov](https://rudolf.intuitive-robots.net/) and [Prof. Dr. Gerhard Neumann](https://alr.iar.kit.edu/21_65.php).
Before that, I obtained both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology.

My research interests focus on **Interactive Imitation Learning**, **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**, and **Robotics**,
especially how to use **Mixed Reality (MR)** Technology to enhance the Human-Robot Interaction for Robot Learning.
